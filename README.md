### [Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Challenge] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%234---MVP) 
Our challenge was to develop and deploy a simple app using OpenFDA datasets to search, explore, & interact with data on medication recalls and adverse events. Our Product Owner developed this challenge after facilitating a design studio with our key Subject Matter Experts (SME) to produce a key user persona for the application. Upon identifying our user persona, a high level feature map was developed to illustrate our MVP concept. Core functionality was focused on; faceted search and analytics around either adverse events or recalls. Team eGT was developed the application using the scrum methodology; building the application over a number of iterations(please the review the links provided below for detailes regarding our sprint objectives and goals.)

### [Team eGT] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%231---Team)
#####Product Owner: Jennifer Hinton,
#####Technical Architect: Eric Hanson,
#####Back End Web Developer: Eric Hanson,
#####Front End Web Developer: Mansi Pandurangi,
#####Automated Test Engineer: Zach Rowe,
#####DevOps Engineer: John Stange,

### [Process & Tools] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%232---Processes-&-Tools)
eGT assembled a DevOps team of experienced engineers and architects, with members chosen for their experience designing web applications using automated testing frameworks, continuous integration and continuous deployment to build and deliver a prototype. Our lead, Jennifer Hinton, facilitated a kick-off meeting to gain alignment on the tech stack and creation of the environment with necessary permissions, collaboration tools, sprint schedules and ceremonies, and determined the MVP challenge based on suggestions from SMEs and the team. We also established our definition of done.

The team followed a daily ceremony schedule, including a DSU to coordinate efforts and remove blockers, a grooming session to slice and prioritize new functionality and to discuss [mock-up designs] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/blob/master/docs/MVP/20150620_123456.jpg) created by the PO, and a sprint review/demo to view and provide suggestions to improve new functionality, provide updates about the infrastructure and testing roadmap, and to close out completed stories in GitHub. In addition to using GitHub for source control and our backlog, we utilized a set of collaboration tools, such as Google Drive, Slack, and JoinMe.
 
### [Technical Stack] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%233---Tech-Stack) 
Team eGT chose to leverage [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) , [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), [Cloudamatic](https://github.com/cloudamatic/cloudamatic/blob/master/README.md/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  etc as they offer maximum productivity in a prototyping effort of this nature. In addition we implemented continuous integration automating the entire build, test and deployment process further enhancing our productivity and accelerating our solutionâ€™s maturity.
