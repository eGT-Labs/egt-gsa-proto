### [Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Challenge](https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%234---Minimum-Viable-Product)
Our challenge was to develop and deploy a simple app using OpenFDA datasets to search, explore, & interact with data on drug labeling and adverse events. Core functionality was focused on faceted search and analytics on adverse events. Team eGT  developed the application using Scrum, enhancing the application over a number of iterations.

For more information, see [MVP Wiki](https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%234---Minimum-Viable-Product).

### [Team](https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%231---Team)
eGT assembled a multi-disciplinary, collaborative DevOps team of experienced engineers, agilists, testers,  and architects, with members chosen for their experience designing web applications using automated testing frameworks, continuous integration and continuous deployment to build and deliver a prototype.

- **Product Owner:** Jennifer Hinton - @jhinton
- **Technical Architect:** Eric Hanson - @jehanson
- **Back End Web Developer**: Eric Hanson -@jehanson
- **Front End Web Developer:** Mansi Pandurangi -@mpandurangi 
- **Automated Test Engineer:** Zach Rowe - @zr2d2
- **DevOps Engineer:** John Stange - @jstange

For more information, see [Team](https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%231---Team).

### [Technical Stack] (https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%233---Tech-Stack) 
Team eGT chose to leverage over five modern, open source tools & frameworks as they offer maximum productivity in a prototyping effort of this nature. We implemented continuous integration automating the entire build, test and deployment process further enhancing our productivity and accelerating our solutionâ€™s maturity. All underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.

### [Process & Tools](https://github.com/eGT-Labs/egt-gsa-proto/wiki/%232---Processes-&-Tools)
 Our lead, Jennifer Hinton, facilitated a kick-off meeting to gain alignment on the tech stack and creation of the environment with necessary permissions, collaboration tools, sprint schedules and ceremonies, and determined the MVP challenge based on suggestions from SMEs and the team. We also established our definition of done. 
 
The team followed a daily ceremony schedule, including a Daily Stand Up to coordinate efforts and remove blockers, a grooming session to slice and prioritize new functionality and to discuss mock-up designs created by the Product Owner, and a sprint review/demo to view and provide suggestions to improve new functionality, provide updates about the infrastructure and testing roadmap, and to close out completed stories in GitHub.
