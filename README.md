### Approach 
Shortly after RFQ drop, eGT assembled a DevOps team of experienced engineers and architects, with members chosen for their experience designing web applications using automated testing frameworks, continuous integration and continuous deployment to build and deliver a prototype. Our lead, Jennifer Hinton facilitated a kick-off meeting to gain alignment on tech stack and creation of environment with necessary permissions, collaboration tools, sprint schedules and ceremonies, and determined the MVP challenge based on suggestions from SMEs and the team. We also established our definition of done.

### Process & Tools
 The team followed the daily ceremony schedule with a DSU to coordinate efforts and remove blockers, a grooming session to slice and prioritize new functionality and to discuss mock-up designs created by the PO, and a sprint review/demos to view and provide suggestions to improve new functionality, provide updates about the infrastructure and testing roadmap, and to close out completed stories in GitHub.In addition to using GitHub for source control we put together a set of collaboration tools namely Google Drive, Slack, etc. (link to export from slack)
 
### Tech Stack 
We decided to adopt Node.js , Angular.js, etc as they offer maximum productivity in a prototyping effort of this nature. In addition we implemented continuous integration automating the entire build, test and deployment process further enhancing our productivity and accelerating our solution’s maturity.

### MVP 
Our challenge was to prove a simple app using OpenFDA datasets to search, explore, & interact with data on medication recalls and adverse events. Our Product Owner developed this challenge after facilitating a design studio with our key SMEs to produce a key user persona for the app. After we identified our user persona, we developed a high level feature map illustrating our MVP concept with core functionality around search faceting and analytics around either adverse events or recalls. 
Win theme: MVP definition – clear priorities drive towards iteration, small chunks, delivering small batches of valuable product; reference issues that indicate how we would address constraints....
