		Catalyst is a tool to help researchers easily explore and
		interact with OpenFDA drug labeling & adverse events data. We named
		the tool Catalyst because we believe by making this data more
		accessible we could help inspire and spark insight on trends for
		specific events & outcomes. We looked at the 
		<a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">OpenFDA</a> 
		API as our competition, and imagined a scenario where a researcher is looking to
		identify unusual correlations between a particular symptom and
		substance. Alternatively, that same researcher is investigating by
		symptoms to explore which drugs have the highest incidence of that
		outcome. We thought we could help researchers easily understand this
		data by building core analytics around the datasets of labeling &
		adverse events.

		What is OpenFDA data?

		The <a href="https://open.fda.gov/about/" target="_blank">openFDA</a> 
		drug adverse event API returns data from the FDA
		Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), a database that contains
		information on adverse event and medication error reports submitted to
		FDA. Currently, this data covers publically releasable records
		submitted to the FDA from 2004-2013. The data is updated quarterly.
	</p>


	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>There are many ways to explore the OpenFDA datasets using Catalyst. Below are a few examples: </p>
	<h5><strong>Want to find all generic forms of a brand name drug?</strong></h5>
	<p style="text-align: justify">
		Enter the brand name into the search label; the right column of
		your return will show summaries of related drug labels, and the left
		column will show the possible ways to filter those results. For example, 
		<a href="/label-search?fulltext=advil">advil</a>, 
		you can learn box warnings, chemical structure, and indications & use. 
		If the dataset is too wide, you can also filter out specific results using 
		the search facets.
	</p>	
	<h5><strong>Want to see the adverse effects of a particular substance or drug?</strong></h5>
	<p style="text-align: justify">
		Enter the drug name into the 
		<a href="/">search label </a>;
	     filter the results by clicking search facets in the left
		column, then click the Adverse Event icon 
		<a href="#" class="h3" style="color: red">â˜¤</a> 
		in the right column next to the ingredient of choice.
	</p>
	<h5><strong>Explore by Cross-referencing Data</strong></h5>
	<p>
	By exploring different features within the data, you can find
	interesting connections, such as all drugs that cause 
	<a href="/event/symptom/NAUSEA">nausea</a>,
	 or that there is a 3.25% rate of suicide from taking 
	 <a href="/event/substance/ACETAMINOPHEN">Acetaminophen</a>.
